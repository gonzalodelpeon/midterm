<p><b>The New School</b> is a private research university in Lower Manhattan, New York City, located mostly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village" target="_blank">Greenwich Village</a>. From its founding in 1919 by progressive New York educators, and for most of its history, the university was known as <i>The New School for Social Research</i>. Between 1997 and 2005 it was known as <u>New School University</u>. The university and each of its colleges were renamed in 2005.</p>

<p>The New School established the University in Exile in 1933 as a graduate division to serve as an academic haven for scholars escaping from Nazi Germany among other adversarial regimes in Europe.[6] In 1934, the University in Exile was chartered by New York State and its name was changed to the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science. In 2005, it adopted what had initially been the name of the whole institution, the New School for Social Research, while the larger institution was renamed The New School.<a href="#one">[1]</a></p>

<p>The New School has launched or housed a range of institutions such as the international research institute World Policy Institute, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vera_List_Center_for_Art_and_Politics" target="_blank">Vera List Center for Art and Politics</a>, the India China Institute, the Observatory on Latin America, and the Center for New York City Affairs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons_School_of_Design" target="_blank">Parsons School of Design</a> is the New School's art school.</p>

<p>Approximately 9,300 students are enrolled in postgraduate and undergraduate degree programs, organized into seven schools which teach a variety of disciplines, including social sciences, liberal arts, humanities, architecture, fine arts, design, music, drama, finance, psychology, and public policy.<a href="#two">[2]</a></p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<h3 id="founding"><i>Founding</i></h3>

<p>The New School for Social Research was founded by a group of university professors and intellectuals in 1919 as a modern, progressive, free school where adult students could "seek an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth and present working." Founders included economist and literary scholar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Saunders_Johnson" target="_blank">Alvin Johnson</a>, historian Charles A. Beard, economists Thorstein Veblen and James Harvey Robinson, and philosophers Horace M. Kallen and John Dewey. Several founders were former professors at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>.</p>
<p>In October 1917, after Columbia University imposed a loyalty oath to the United States upon the entire faculty and student body, it fired several professors. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_A._Beard">Charles A. Beard</a>, Professor of Political Science, resigned his professorship at Columbia in protest. His colleague James Harvey Robinson resigned in 1919 to join the faculty at the New School.</p>
<p>The New School plan was to offer the rigorousness of postgraduate education without degree matriculation or degree prerequisites. It was theoretically open to anyone, as the adult division today called Schools of Public Engagement remains. The first classes at the New School took the form of lectures followed by discussions, for larger groups, or as smaller conferences, for "those equipped for specific research." In the first semester, 100 courses, mostly in economics and politics, were offered by an ad hoc faculty that included Thomas Sewall Adams, Charles A. Beard, Horace M. Kallen, Harold Laski, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Thorstein Veblen, James Harvey Robinson, Graham Wallas, Charles B. Davenport, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsie_Clews_Parsons">Elsie Clews Parsons</a>, and Roscoe Pound. John Cage later pioneered the subject of Experimental Composition at the school.</p>

<h3 id="philosophical"><i>Philosophical tradition</i></h3>

<p>The New School for Social Research continues the Graduate Faculty's tradition of synthesizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism">leftist</a> American intellectual thought and critical European philosophy. True to its origin and its firm roots within the University in Exile, The New School for Social Research, particularly its Department of Philosophy, is in the minority in the United States in offering students thorough training in the modern continental European philosophical tradition known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_philosophy">Continental philosophy</a>." Thus, it stresses the teachings of Parmenides, Aristotle, Leibniz, Spinoza, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt">Arendt</a>, Freud, Benjamin, Wittgenstein, Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, et al.<a href="#three">[3]</a> The thought of the Critical Theory of the Frankfurt School: Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Jürgen Habermas, et al. holds an especially strong influence on all divisions of the school. After the death of Hannah Arendt in 1975, the philosophy department revolved around Reiner Schürmann and Ágnes Heller.</p>

<h2 id="academics">Academics</h2>

<h3 id="curriculum"><i>Curriculum</i></h3>

<p>Unlike most U.S. universities, The New School has a "student-directed curriculum", which does not require its undergraduates to take general education courses. Instead, students are encouraged to explore before focusing on a major, selecting topics that are of interest to them. Although all "New Schoolers" are required to complete rigorous core training—usually of a literary, conservatory, or artistic nature—students are expected to be the primary designer of their own individualized and eclectic education.</p>

<p>The New School's curriculum is highly experimental and avant-garde, offering classes such as: "Heterodox Identities," "Games 101," "NYC: Graphic Gotham," "Punk &amp; Noise," "Masculinity in Asia," "Queer Culture," and "Play and Toil in the Digital Sweatshop."<a href="#four">[4]</a> The New School also offers a course titled "Social Media: The Power to Speak the Truth." The course explores the transformative history of the Internet and provides a working knowledge of the tools it offers for journalism and public action.</p>

<p>The university offers 81 degree/diploma programs and majors, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 9:1.<a href="#five">[5]</a> This small class size allows The New School to teach most of its classes in the seminar style—especially at Eugene Lang College, which consistently ranks at the top of The Princeton Review's "class discussions encouraged" national listing.<a href="#six">[6]</a></p>

<h3 id="institutes"><i>The New School Institutes and Research Centers</i></h3>

<p>There are several important institutes and research centers at The New School which are focused on various study fields. Their work is concentrated in the following areas:</p>
